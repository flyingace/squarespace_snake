# Snake

This game was built on top of [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) though much of what that package ships
 with has been stripped out. It also makes use of the [lodash](https://lodash.com/) method [*isMatch()*](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#isMatch) but apart from the bulk of the JavaScript code written to make this game 
 function uses vanilla JS including many ES6 elements.
 
 The game can be viewed and played here: [https://flyingace.github.io/squarespace_snake/](https://flyingace.github.io/squarespace_snake/).
